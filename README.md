# LoRaChatESP
This project demonstrates bidirectional communication between two ESP32 devices using RA-02 LoRa modules. The system allows the devices to exchange messages in real-time over long distances. Each device operates as both a transmitter (TX) and a receiver (RX), enabling a simple chat-like interaction.
